I'm passionate for technology and an enthusiast for tech communities like PyLadies. I'm completing my underdegree in Data Science at the Federal University of Para√≠ba and experience in OCR, machine imaging and deep learning, using tools such as Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch and SQL.

I am interested in applying advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems and generate meaningful insights. In addition, I am active in technology communities, participating in events and sharing knowledge.

I'm a proactive, organized and results-oriented person with effective communication skills and teamwork skills. I'm constantly looking for professional development opportunities and am excited to contribute to data science projects.

I'm available to share more about my experience and discuss how I can contribute to your project or organization.
