I am passionate about technology and a fervent enthusiast of tech communities. Currently, I'm pursuing my undergraduate degree in Data Science at the Federal University of Para√≠ba. I have experience in Remote Sensing, OCR, machine learning, and deep learning, utilizing tools such as Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and SQL.

I am keen on applying advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems and generate meaningful insights. Furthermore, I actively participate in technology communities, attending events, and sharing knowledge.

As a proactive, organized, and results-oriented individual, I possess effective communication and teamwork skills. I am consistently seeking professional development opportunities and am eager to contribute to data science projects.

I am open to discussing more about my experience and how I can contribute to your project or organization.
