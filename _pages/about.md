I am a Data Scientist with over 4 years of experience building scalable, production-ready solutions that drive customer engagement and business growth. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between complex statistical modeling and actionable product strategies.

I specialize in developing end-to-end forecasting and recommendation engines, utilizing robust cloud ecosystems like AWS and Azure. I have a proven track record of optimizing delivery timelines and enhancing lead conversion through rigorous $A/B$ testing and advanced segmentation.

Core Competencies & Impact
- *Machine Learning Lifecycle:* Full-cycle experience from EDA and hypothesis testing to $A/B$ frameworks and model deployment.
- *Scalable Data Engineering:* Building high-performance APIs with FastAPI and managing containerized environments using Docker and Kubernetes.
- *Strategic Forecasting:* Developing end-to-end solutions for the CPG sector to optimize executive decision-making and delivery timelines.
- *Technical Leadership:* Active mentor in the PyLadies community, promoting diversity and technical growth within the data science ecosystem.

I hold a B.S. in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB). I am passionate about leveraging data to solve high-stakes problems and am open to relocation for the right global challenge.
